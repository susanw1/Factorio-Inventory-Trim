Inventory Trim
===========

You know when your main inventory is jammed with slots containing small numbers of surplus items? You've picked up few pieces of belt and a chest, and now you've got slots containing 2 extra Inserters, 6 pieces of damaged Wall, 9 pieces of Iron Plate and ... well, junk.

This mod enables *inventory trimming*: your main inventory is scanned periodically to see if there are slots that are being used inefficiently, and throws their contents into the logistics trash. Hurrah, no more clicky-clicky to get rid of the rubbish!

Features
--------

* Trims away items in small stacks that are taking up slots.
* Identifies less useful items to trim first (eg damaged items).
* Keeps at least 10 slots free (configurable) by trimming more assertively, and tries HARD to keep 2 slots free (also configurable).
* Won't remove your last stack of some item, unless you tell it to.

Rationale
------

I keep finding, from around mid-game, that my inventory is always sort of full, and that many slots are occupied with low value items. I can set logistics minimums to get rid of things, but they feel like a heavy-handed and broad-brush solution. I don't mind having 100 Inserters (2 stacks) but I do mind having 53 - also 2 stacks - and then finding I'm out of space. This mod aims to fix that, whilst being more sensitive to circumstances.

Trimming is only meaningful in a world where you have logistics and auto-trash, so it is assumed that you are at a point in the game where carrying small items of stuff isn't so critical. Much of your inventory content is likely to be under automated configuration anyway. The aim of trimming should be to deal with the annoyance of never having much space and pruning the junk.
