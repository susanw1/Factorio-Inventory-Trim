[mod-setting-name]
schedule-period-ticks=Time between scheduled trims
trim-enabled=Enable inventory trimming
stack-trimming-threshold=Trim a stack when it is this full
notification-flying-text-enabled=Show flying text notification when items are auto-trashed
inventory-slots-used-trimming-active-threshold=Only trim when inventory has this proportion of slots used
inventory-slots-keep-free=Perform more trimming to keep this many slots free
inventory-slots-aggressively-keep-free=Perform heavy trimming to ensure this many slots are always free
trim-unhealthy-items-first=Prioritize trimming damaged items
pickup-margin=Space left at end of slot to allow for item pickup
hold-off-time-secs=Time delay before trimming (secs)

[mod-setting-description]
schedule-period-ticks=Number of ticks between scheduled trimming scans. Too small means wasting CPU on pointless scans, and too big means that trimming happens rarely and intermittently. Ideally choose a prime number to prevent CPU loads from coinciding.\nOnly change this if you feel strongly about it!
trim-enabled=Master switch to stop the mod from running on your inventory
stack-trimming-threshold=Threshold contents for an inventory slot to be eligible for trimming, as a proportion of stack-size. If you have 318 coal (stack-size=100) and this setting is at 0.2, then the threshold is 20 and the stack of 18 would be considered less than this - that stack would be moved to trash to clear the slot.
notification-flying-text-enabled=Controls whether flying text notification appears to indicate which items (and quantities) are being automatically moved to trash.
inventory-slots-used-trimming-active-threshold=If you set this to 0.6, then 60% of your inventory slots must be occupied before trimming is activated.\nThis stops the trimmer from running when there are plenty of slots available.
inventory-slots-keep-free=If there are fewer than this many slots empty, then some items may be moved to trash to free up slots, even if their stacks are full.
inventory-slots-aggressively-keep-free=Heavy trimming removes items until this many slots are free.
trim-unhealthy-items-first=Damaged items are stacked separately and use up inventory slots. This setting ensures that they are the first to be trimmed.
pickup-margin=If there are excess slots used by an item, then prevent the last slot from being completely full to allow for a little leeway. This allows you to pick up a few items manually without using an extra slot (eg picking up transport-belt). A value of 0.1 means to only fill the last stack to 90%.
hold-off-time-secs=Wait at least this long before applying a trim. Note that this defines a minimum hold-off delay, as the actual trim is executed on a regular schedule.
