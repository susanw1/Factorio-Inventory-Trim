[mod-setting-description]
trim-enabled=Master switch to stop the mod from running on your inventory
stack-trimming-threshold=Threshold contents for an inventory slot to be eligible for trimming. If you have 318 coal (stack-size=100) and this setting is at 0.2, then the threshold is 20 and the stack of 18 would be considered less than this. That stack would be moved to trash.
notification-flying-text-enabled=Controls whether a message appears to indicate which items (and quantities) are being automatically moved to trash.
inventory-slots-used-trimming-active-threshold=If you set this to 0.6, then 60% of your inventory slots must be occupied before trimming is activated.\nThis stops the trimmer from running when there are plenty of slots available.
inventory-slots-keep-free=If there are fewer than this many slots empty, then some items may be moved to trash to free up slots, even if their stacks are quite full.
inventory-slots-aggressively-keep-free=Heavy trimming removes items until this many slots are free.
trim-unhealthy-items-first=Damaged items are stacked separately and use up inventory slots. This setting ensures that they are the first to be trimmed.
pickup-margin=If there are excess slots used by an item, then prevent the last slot from being completely full to allow for a little leeway. This allows you to pick up a few items manually without using an extra slot (eg picking up transport-belt). A value of 0.1 means to only fill the last stack to 90%.
